# DemoApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.2.

## App Installation
Make sure you have Node.js installed globally. Clone the project. Go into that directory, and run `npm install` - this will install the needed Javascript packages. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API Configuration

In the `environments\config.ts` there is a configuration object. Set the configuration using the credentials Iteris support provided.

## Notes
This is the a very bare bones demo. One of these components could be turned into an Angular Element for easy of embedding into any web application - allowing for the growth or location to be passed into the component.
